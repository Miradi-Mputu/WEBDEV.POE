            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Established in 2020 by siblings Maya and Liam, The Green Thumb Collective began as a passion project for sustainable 
                gardening and quickly grew into a trusted local service.
                 They started by offering basic garden maintenance to friends and family, and through word-of-mouth, 
                 expanded their services to include bespoke garden design, organic pest control, 
                 and native plant consultations. 
                Their focus is on eco-friendly practices and creating beautiful, low-maintenance outdoor spaces.
